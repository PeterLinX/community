# Funding

This document outlines how donations will be allocated for the NEO•ONE community. Donations will be held in AXwyLrPwqjGNPa3v2iLBrCqJwpXtd9v2WZ. Fund usages broadly falls along three categories - contributor awards, community outreach and owner support. In order to bootstrap the community, the majority of initial funds will be used on community outreach and owner support. As the community is built over time, fund allocation will shift towards community awards.

## Contributor Awards

Contributors are awarded to foster community engagement and contribution. Active [contributors](community-membership.md) will be eligible to receive awards for contributions (code, reviews, discussion, or otherwise as deemed by the Owners).

On the 1st of January, April, July and October of every year, a portion of donations will be set aside for the contributor award pool. The size of the pool will depend on available funds, current and planned obligations and expected award demand. Contributions will be considered for awards on an individual and aggregate basis by the Owners. In order to promptly award contributors and promote frequent contributions, one Owner will propose an award with justification for contribution(s) and one Owner will approve the award. Once approved, the contribution will be paid out within three days. In addition, Owners may publicly pre-approve awards for contributions. A record of awards will be publicly available, unless the contributor requests the award be anonymous, in which case the record will only contain the amount awarded. The full record will be privately available to the Owners for auditing and for reference in determining future contributor awards.

## Community Outreach

NEO•ONE will hold community meetups, workshops, hackathons and other in-person events to promote both NEO and NEO•ONE in the community. Funds will be allocated towards this effort to subsidize events and promote attendance through raffels, "swag" giveaways, etc.

## Owner Support

Owners that work in a full time capacity on NEO•ONE will be directly supported. Owners directly supported by NEO•ONE are not eligible for contributor awards. Owners who are eligible for contributor awards may not propose or approve their own awards.

### TODO:

 - Move to a multisig donation wallet among owners
 - Add where the record of awards is available
